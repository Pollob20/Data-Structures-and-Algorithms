TOH(3, A, B, C)

Step 1: Move 2 disks from A to C using B
    TOH(2, A, C, B)
    Step 1.1: Move 1 disk from A to B
        TOH(1, A, B, C)
        Move disk 1 from A to B
    Step 1.2: Move disk 2 from A to C
    Step 1.3: Move 1 disk from B to C
        TOH(1, B, C, A)
        Move disk 1 from B to C

Step 2: Move disk 3 from A to B

Step 3: Move 2 disks from C to B using A
    TOH(2, C, B, A)
    Step 3.1: Move 1 disk from C to A
        TOH(1, C, A, B)
        Move disk 1 from C to A
    Step 3.2: Move disk 2 from C to B
    Step 3.3: Move 1 disk from A to B
        TOH(1, A, B, C)
        Move disk 1 from A to B
it is indetails algorithm .... it is not the exat code.
